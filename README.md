# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## Abstract

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of predicting diabetes using various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques on the Pima Indians dataset. The methodology involved data preprocessing (such as imputation of missing values, normalization, and encoding), followed by model building using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Additionally, we explored advanced deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model.

Our findings indicated that the CNN model achieved the highest accuracy of **98.5%**, followed by the RNN model (98.2%), and the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture (97.7%). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in predicting diabetes by capturing both spatial and temporal relationships in medical data.

## 1. Introduction

Diabetes is a significant global health challenge, especially Type 2 diabetes, which is characterized by elevated blood sugar levels. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are essential for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a robust classification model for predicting Type 2 diabetes using patient data, including glucose levels, insulin levels, BMI, blood pressure, and more.

We leverage deep learning techniques to create a model that autonomously learns to classify diabetes based on patient attributes. The Pima Indians dataset is used as the primary data source, which provides key features for classification.

## 2. Motivation

The motivation for this project arises from the increasing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes globally. Early diagnosis and timely intervention can significantly reduce the risks associated with the disease. The integration of machine learning and deep learning methods has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving diagnosis accuracy, reducing the burden on medical professionals, and providing timely interventions.

Additionally, this project serves as an educational platform to highlight the applications of AI in healthcare, aiming to inspire and educate others on the transformative potential of these technologies.
